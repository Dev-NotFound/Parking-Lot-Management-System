# Parking-Lot-Management-System

A logic-driven simulation of a parking facility using **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** in Python. This project demonstrates how Python's dynamic lists can be utilized to implement Stack and Queue behaviors for real-world automation.


## 🛠️ System Logic
- **Parking Area (Stack):** Implements Last-In, First-Out (LIFO) logic for vehicle retrieval.
- **Waiting List (Queue):** Implements First-In, First-Out (FIFO) logic to ensure the first car waiting is the first one parked when a spot opens.
- **State Management:** Tracks 10 unique parking spots using an occupancy array to prevent double-booking.

## 🚀 Key Python Features
- **Object-Oriented Design:** Car data is encapsulated in a class for better data integrity.
- **Dynamic Queue Management:** Leverages Python's list slicing and popping for efficient queue handling.
- **Human-Readable Logs:** Timestamps are formatted using the `time` library for better UX.

## 🖥️ How to Run
1. Ensure you have Python 3.x installed.
2. Clone the repo: `git clone https://github.com/yourusername/parking-system-python`
3. Run the script: `python parking_management.py`
